                        A: Back during the summer of 2003, many people in the BnG community thought the community was lacking fellowship, and ultimately "dying." NessTheHero found Continuum at Starman.net, through a tournament they were holding, and decided it would be fun to get some BnGers involved.

                        A: Officially, it was protoman_116, but only because he was the only one who knew how to make a squad. NessTheHero brought us all to the game, so you could say he founded it also. The leadership was eventually passed to GB330033, who leads it now.

There's also AIM, and other IM programs, including XFire, which is nifty. We also, from time to time, use voice chat programs. Check the IRC channel for that information.

                        A: Well, "raid" is a Continuum term we use to refer to when our squad goes out and private-freqs in a public arena. This is one of our favorite things to do, as it spices up our time on the game, and pub life. We try to not outnumber a pub, so if one empties after we've been raiding a while, we'll either change arenas, or stop raiding.
