  TheBaconma> Too bad no one cares what you say.
  TheBaconma> Wait, who's the Timer?
    GB330033> It's fine as long as you dont cloak/stealth
  MagnusRage> Ripout all your limbs and teeth, use your gums.

    TheBaconma> LAWLALALWLALW
  Des Gardiu> Shouldn't we wait for more people?
  TheBaconma> Wait, we need to go to team chat.
  MagnusRage> I don't think anyone cares.
  MagnusRage> XD
  TheBaconma> Everyone, get to your places.
  Des Gardiu> Hold on
  TheBaconma> Gardius, Left.
T MagnusRage> omg what?
    TheBaconma> GB, Right.
  MagnusRage> HEY. I'M THE JUDGE.
  TheBaconma> No one cares. :p
  MagnusRage> Gardius, to the left safe!
    MagnusRage> Geebs, to the right.
  TheBaconma> Go judge a Sausage fest.
  MagnusRage> Sir Baconman, use teamchat please.
    Des Gardiu> Okay, had to yell in the squad chat
  TheBaconma> Same h33r
T TheBaconma> I think
  Des Gardiu> So what, should we not see what each person uses?
  MagnusRage> Now then...
T TheBaconma> That they both will lose.
T MagnusRage> Probably.
  Des Gardiu> Just assume the worst and go from there?
  MagnusRage> No, you just both need a starting point.
  MagnusRage> Plus that.
  MagnusRage> Sure. Whatever.
  Des Gardiu> I'm in the left safe
  MagnusRage> No then, it's first to 10, correct?
  TheBaconma> Anyways, do you know ALL OF THE RULES
  TheBaconma> ALL OF THEM
    GB330033> Hang on, I'm reading over the stuff
  TheBaconma> No, Magnus.
    TheBaconma> 15 minutes.
  Des Gardiu> Try and rope a few more people in, just so the spec chat will be more interesting
    Des Gardiu> :|
  TheBaconma> The timer starts the match.
    MagnusRage> Right, right.
    GB330033> Alright, as far as switching ships, there's nothing written down
  TheBaconma> GB
    GB330033> But basically, don't change ships when you're about to be shot or anything
  Des Gardiu> I say we shouldn't
    TheBaconma> You're not allowed to switch ship-- yeah.
    GB330033> You can change ships if you want
    GB330033> But not in the middle of an engagement
  TheBaconma> You can't change if you're getting chased/shot at.
    MagnusRage> You may change ships, but I'll decide if it's used to dodge or not.
  Des Gardiu> But what if you swap, and wind up next to the opponent?
  MagnusRage> No spawn killing is a rule.
  TheBaconma> It's considered Spawning.
    TheBaconma> So you both have 3 or so seconds of immunity.
  Des Gardiu> Spawn killing equals minus 1 or something?
  TheBaconma> No.
  TheBaconma> You get warned.
    GB330033> No, one is a warning, two is death
  Des Gardiu> I so wish more people were here
  MagnusRage> Alright.
  TheBaconma> If it happens again, DISCUMBOBUFIED.
  MagnusRage> Now, as for the fighting area...
  Des Gardiu> Ready at any time
    Des Gardiu> I just hope I don't get punted
  MagnusRage> From the width of the base, to the bottom safe?
    GB330033> Essentially, don't go in the base, don't go outside of the safes
  MagnusRage> Alright, that works.
    MagnusRage> Everyone agreed?
    GB330033> Hang on...
    GB330033> F-ing Rick...
  TheBaconma> Rick?
  TheBaconma> o' Shay?

  T MagnusRage> Me.
T TheBaconma> Am I your assisstant judge?
T MagnusRage> Sure. But keep it to teamchat. =P
T TheBaconma> Okay.
T MagnusRage> Yes?
T TheBaconma> You keep an eye on Gardius, I got GB.
T MagnusRage> Heh. I was about to ask you to do that.
  T MagnusRage> So smart!@
  Des Gardiu> Gah, what did I tell you? Father just got back with groceries
    Des Gardiu> Nope, false alarm. I'm still good
  TheBaconma> Tell him to F--- off, you're in a life and death game.

  Des Gardiu> We can fight
  Des Gardiu> Ready

  MagnusRage> Start when I say so.
  T TheBaconma> Remember, Magnus.  Scores are posted at 10, 5, and 1 minute left.
    GB330033> ...
  TheBaconma> He's syncing up the time.
  Des Gardiu> He wants to start at 8:10 apparently
    GB330033> Ah
  Des Gardiu> Is the log on?
  TheBaconma> Yes
    Des Gardiu> Okay
  MagnusRage> START!!!!
T MagnusRage> Hah, suspense.
  T TheBaconma> And we're off to a Rousing match, of the first continuum tourney, in atleast a year.
T MagnusRage> Well said, Mr. Bacon.
T TheBaconma> I'm here, along with the head judge, Magnus.
  T TheBaconma> Magnus, what are your thoughts?
T MagnusRage> Good to be here.
T TheBaconma> Wow! Already GB is in a 2 point lead!
  T MagnusRage> So, Gardius seems to be off to a somewhat disheartening start, wouldn't you say?
T TheBaconma> I guess all those steriods are really adding to GB's game.
      GB330033> Nice
T TheBaconma> And we have a kill from Gardius!
T MagnusRage> Oh! And he charges for a kill!
  T       T.J.> :O
T TheBaconma> And we have just been joined by the Squad Mascot, TJ.
T MagnusRage> And now my esteemed colleuge, T.J, joins us!
T       T.J.> Who's winning?
T TheBaconma> TJ what are your thoughts?
T       T.J.> Well, it looks like Gardius is missing
T       T.J.> A lot
T MagnusRage> Geebs leads by a slight margin.
  T MagnusRage> oh! A nice nice.
T MagnusRage> Shot, whatever.
T TheBaconma> And a nice shot made by the Texan from...
T TheBaconma> ...Something that rhymes with Texan~!
T MagnusRage> Wisconsin?
  T       T.J.> And Gardius bumps into a wall!
  Des Gardiu> Damn you and your sharpshooting
  Des Gardiu> :P
T       T.J.> Now he's run into a bullet
    GB330033> :P
  T MagnusRage> Gardius seems to of taken to just randomly firing in whatever direction necessary!
T       T.J.> He really needs to get those brakes looked at
T TheBaconma> Hahah! That reminds me of a riddle I knew when I was but a small black child, growing up in the ghettos of Suburbia!
  T MagnusRage> How do you feel this strategy will fare for him?
T TheBaconma> I believe that it will do much.
T       T.J.> I think hejust might pull it off
T TheBaconma> In the way of wasting energy.
T MagnusRage> Well, said again, Mr. Bacon.
  T MagnusRage> Any thoughts on the possible outcome of this match?
T       T.J.> Score for Gardius!
    GB330033> PEW PEW PEW
T TheBaconma> It looks like GB is faring well with his Warbir-- OH! A nice shot from Gardius!
T       T.J.> Random firing pays off
T      Forai> you wanna know what I think
  Des Gardiu> Time
T      Forai> I AM A BEAR!
  MagnusRage> 4 minutes.
       Forai> uh oh
T       T.J.> I think he meant pause =P
  MagnusRage> Oh.
    GB330033> He meant time out
  MagnusRage> Geebs, to your safe please.
T MagnusRage> Forai, keep to team chat. =P
T TheBaconma> It seems that Gardius has taken a time out, wouldn't you think so, Mr. Rage?
  T MagnusRage> It's the only explanation.
T TheBaconma> Mr. J, what are your thougts?
  T TheBaconma> And by Thougts, I mean thoughts.
T       T.J.> Well Mr. Bacon, it looks like GB is doing a good job of sitting there
  T       T.J.> I don't think I've ever seen it done so well before
T TheBaconma> Indeed, I like his form.
  MagnusRage> SCORE: GB - 4, Gardius - 2
T TheBaconma> The way he sits is, indeed, a remarkable addition to this game.
T       T.J.> Fans will remember this for years to come
T MagnusRage> Indeed, Mr. T.J.
T TheBaconma> Indeed he will, Mr. J.
T MagnusRage> It shall be remembered aas the Texan Squat.
T TheBaconma> Ah, indeed.
  T MagnusRage> Whew. Had one too many drinks. I'm slurring my words a bit there.
T MagnusRage> Oh well.
T TheBaconma> I rather like Gardius' method of sitting.
T TheBaconma> Instead of returning to his seat, he has joined us in the commentator booth!
T TheBaconma> What do you have to say about that, Mr. Gardius?
    MagnusRage> What rules are there on how long you can leave from a match, Geebs?
    GB330033> None, that I know of
T       T.J.> Some might call it blasphemy, but I call it creativity!
  MagnusRage> There aren't any written.
T TheBaconma> Indeed it is, Mr. J.
  T MagnusRage> I call it "GET IN THERE AND FIGHT, YA BUM!"
T TheBaconma> This match is brought to you by our sponser, Ness' Website Repair.  "If we can't fix it... well, we tried."
T MagnusRage> Or sponsers include McHappy Burger and UrutoraD's modeling agency!
  T TheBaconma> It's also sad to report that, we are on Ness' payroll, and he has had us reclassified us as Slaves.
T MagnusRage> What great sponsers, don't you think?
T       T.J.> Yes they are
T TheBaconma> Indeed they are, Magnus.
      GB330033> Hmmm...
T TheBaconma> And it appears that Gardius has left the Arena!
T MagnusRage> Now it appears Gardius has left altogether!
T TheBaconma> Is there a farking Echo?
T MagnusRage> Shutup, Mr. Bacon! Quit stealing my lines.
    MagnusRage> What to do now.
T TheBaconma> No, you shut up, Mr. Rage!
  MagnusRage> Is he in the chat still?
T TheBaconma> Don't make me get the Bacon out!
    GB330033> Yes
T       T.J.> I dunno about you guys, but while we're sitting here commenting on this amazing match, I work up quite a thirst
    GB330033> We wait, I suppose
  MagnusRage> Alright.
    GB330033> I have no problem with waiting
T TheBaconma> So, anyways, Mr. Rage.
T       T.J.> So I quench my drinkly desire with some great tasting UltraD
  T MagnusRage> What a great sport, that GB!
T TheBaconma> Do you want to play Stickball in this incredibly cramped space, that, I might add, that Ness shrunk to 3x5 feet?
T       T.J.> Now in berry, slightly berry, and off berry flavors
T MagnusRage> Despite his opponents outragous behavior, Geebs still shows composure and leadership!
T MagnusRage> I never thought you're ask, Mr. Bacon.
T TheBaconma> Mmm, that DOES sound like quite a drink, TJ.
  T TheBaconma> But does it come in UltraBerry?
T      Forai> I LIKE TOMATOES 
T       T.J.> Wouldn't ya know? It does! Brand new UltraBerry flavor available in stores now
T MagnusRage> Oh my! Our other friendly commentator has finally broken his/her silence.
T MagnusRage> I'm not quite sure on their gender.
  T TheBaconma> I believe they are of the Female Gender.
T MagnusRage> ... A girl? onoz!
T TheBaconma> But, that drink sure does make me Hungry!
T MagnusRage> Indeed!
  MagnusRage> How long do we give him?
T TheBaconma> Wouldn't you know it, There's Baconman brand Bacon!
T      Forai> you guys haven't lived till you tried the new SHEETZ Icecream milkshakes!
T       T.J.> Sounds MSGriffic Mr. Bacon
T TheBaconma> Located in your Grocier's freezer aisle.
  T TheBaconma> It is, TJ. It is.
  Des Gardiu> Sorry 'bout that
T TheBaconma> And Gardius has Returned!
T       T.J.> And Gardius has returned to the arena! After a quick shot of UltraD, he's ready to go!
    GB330033> No problem
T MagnusRage> Now, during this special intermission, we here at the Squad BnG broadcasting Association would like to pay special tribute to the thing that brought us together. That's right, Bob and George. Dear Lord, how it's oggten boring. Why doesn't he quit?
  MagnusRage> Alright.
  MagnusRage> Ready?
    GB330033> Starting from where we left off?
T TheBaconma> Magnus, you've had a bit too much.
  Des Gardiu> Sure
  T TheBaconma> You're slurring again.
  Des Gardiu> Ready
  MagnusRage> Yes. 10 Minutes left.
  MagnusRage> GO.
T       T.J.> Yes Magnus, have some UltraD  instead
T TheBaconma> You should cut back on the Alcohol dipped Bacon.
  MagnusRage> SCORE: GB - 4, Gardius: 2
  T MagnusRage> Eh, I enjoy my whiskey.
T TheBaconma> Which, I might remind our viewers, is made by Baconman brand Bacon!
T TheBaconma> If your hearts still pumping, we'll add more MSG's!
T MagnusRage> lawlz
T       T.J.> Gardius just ate like a vegan in a meat factory Magnus!
T MagnusRage> You are correct!
T TheBaconma> And GB goes down with a lucky shot by Gardius!
T       T.J.> Look at that! The UltraD has improved Gardius' accuracy!
T MagnusRage> GB's lead is slimming, however. Gardius could tie!
  
T MagnusRage> And he does!
T TheBaconma> And Gardius adds another 20 bullets into GB's hull!
T       T.J.> Gardius could tie his shoes, if he knew how
T MagnusRage> AND HE TAKES THE LEAD!
T TheBaconma> And Gardius has broken the tie!
T       T.J.> Another point to Gardius! This man is on fire!
  Des Gardiu> :D
T TheBaconma> Double kill!
T MagnusRage> Oh, a double kill!
T       T.J.> AAOOOOOGGGGGAAAA!!
T MagnusRage> While it makes no difference in the score, it sure is funny.
T TheBaconma> Now, If I'm not mistaken...
T       T.J.> Double Kill!
T TheBaconma> In the rule book, a double kill does not count.
T TheBaconma> And O M F G viewers!
  Des Gardiu> Score?
T       T.J.> Quite right Mr. Bacon
T TheBaconma> GB has switched to a Spider!
T MagnusRage> You are correct. Keep track of any DKs, Mr. Bacon.
    GB330033> XD
  T TheBaconma> Another Double kill!
T TheBaconma> Speak of the devil, Mr. Rage!
T MagnusRage> Oh, a tie again!
T       T.J.> Oh...GB fires back
T MagnusRage> This match is getting good!
T TheBaconma> ...No, really. Tell me about him.  I heard that you go bowling with him every thursday.
T       T.J.> Gardius takes the lead!
T MagnusRage> He quit talking to me after I got a girlfriend, sadly. Something about making his house really cold.
T       T.J.> Isn't that stealing?
  Des Gardiu> :D
T TheBaconma> Another double kill!
T MagnusRage> Well, I must say, this is going nowhere.
T       T.J.> Oh Magnus, your jokes are so funny when they're reused from webcomics
T MagnusRage> ... Who has done it?
T       T.J.> Applegeeks
  T MagnusRage> ... Curses. People need to stop making fun of the "hell froze over" line.
T MagnusRage> Jerks.
T       T.J.> Yeah, that'll happen when hell freezes over
T TheBaconma> I might remind you, that the bullets and ships used today are supplied by Striker's Godmode Shop!
T MagnusRage> Oh!
 T TheBaconma> If it's not Godmoding, then it's broken!
T MagnusRage> Quite!
T TheBaconma> Rather!
  T       T.J.> Dan?
T MagnusRage> It seems both competetors are not capable of holding a lead for long!
T MagnusRage> Let's see if Gardius can.
  T       T.J.> I don't blame them. Lead is pretty heavy
  T TheBaconma> I might remind the viewers, that the Monocle and Tophat are supplied by Magnus' dress shop!  "Because we're too much of a pussy to give out a gun!"
T MagnusRage> At least I look nice.
T TheBaconma> Atleast I have a gun.
  T MagnusRage> It's like Fashion Core music. They can't make music, but DANG they look good.
T       T.J.> Guns don't kill, but looks do
T TheBaconma> Like Brittany Spe-- no, Christina-- no...
    GB330033> XD
T MagnusRage> lawlz
T TheBaconma> They don't look good OR make good music.
  Des Gardiu> :D
T MagnusRage> Well, it seems we're at a standstill.
T TheBaconma> This match looks like it's being Double killed out the Ying Yang!
T       T.J.> Well, it seems you were wrong
T MagnusRage> How do you use chatmode again?
T TheBaconma> The Ying Yangs used today are sponsered by Mr. Wangs Ying Yang shop.
T      Forai> dare I say it... Pwned
T       T.J.> The read chat? ;
T TheBaconma> Indeed you do dare.
T TheBaconma> It seems we're almost at a tie.
T MagnusRage> Oh!
T TheBaconma> Gardius is winning, by 2 points.
T       T.J.> Mr. Wang's Ying Yang Shop. Bigger. Better.
  MagnusRage> ONE MINUTE LEFT!
  MagnusRage> I kinda forgot to announce stuff...
T TheBaconma> The score is something like... 10-8
    GB330033> I noticed
T MagnusRage> Could there be a comback?!?!
T TheBaconma> I lost track when I injected that grease directly into my Blood!
  Des Gardiu> What kidn of judge areyou?
T       T.J.> Gardiu's best coure of action right now would be to run around the arena like a scared little girl, right Magnus?
  MagnusRage> Well, Time.
      GB330033> Good match
    GB330033> I lose
  Des Gardiu> What's the score?
    Des Gardiu> Good game
  T TheBaconma> GARDIUS WINS THE MATCH!
    GB330033> 21-22
    GB330033> You

T MagnusRage> How many DKs were there?
T TheBaconma> Around 10.
  Des Gardiu> Nah, I think you killed me more
  MagnusRage> Official score is 12-11.
T TheBaconma> Folks, I can't believe it!
T       T.J.> It doesn't matter, both of their scores go up, so it makes no difference
  MagnusRage> Gardius is the winner.
  Des Gardiu> Good game
  T TheBaconma> This is history in the making!
    GB330033> How is it only 12 and 11?
  MagnusRage> Dks don't count.
        T.J.> Congratulations Gardius!
T TheBaconma> Someone won a continuum game!
    GB330033> Ah
  MagnusRage> So it doesn't really make a difference.
    GB330033> Indeed
        T.J.> Tell the viewers at home, how did UltraD help you win?
    Des Gardiu> I'm heading back to the chatroom. See you guys there
  MagnusRage> lawlz
    GB330033> XD
  MagnusRage> What have we learned today?!
    MagnusRage> Magnus is a terrible judge, but darn sexy.
