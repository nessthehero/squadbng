T             UrutoraD> Not in this case
T        protodude_116> But GB can't use it worth crap.
T        protodude_116> Yes, GB, I said it.
T             UrutoraD> Mainly because he hasn't played in forever

              Madarrow> 5 Minutes remaining.
T             UrutoraD> You would think that being directly infront of a Lanc would equal death
              Madarrow> Blade:19      GB:12
T        protodude_116> Wow.
         Blade_Serpent> GRM:SLDKFLKJRH
T        protodude_116> If that were me, he'd have been dead right there.

T             UrutoraD> onoz
T        protodude_116> When GB spawned and Blade passed infront of him.
T        protodude_116> Now, if this was Old Lanq vs. Spider, GB would be kicking soo much ass.
              GB330033> Alrighty then, changing again
T        protodude_116> the spider isn't really effective against the Lancaster.
              GB330033> Spider is boring
              GB330033> :P
         Blade_Serpent> Heh

T        protodude_116> If Blade is smart, he'll stay away :p
T        Striker Omega> At this rate, it's entirely possible.
         Blade_Serpent> 26, 20.
T        protodude_116> I think that Jacen is playing GB's computer :p
T             UrutoraD> :P
T        Striker Omega> It's not making any difference whether or not Blade's staying away, because GB is sniping liek mad whut
T             UrutoraD> What the crap was that!?
