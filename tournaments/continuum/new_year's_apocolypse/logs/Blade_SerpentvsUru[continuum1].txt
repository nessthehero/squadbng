T NessTheHer> I bet some pocket lint on Blade
T protodude_> I bet you'll start talking to your girlfriend and not pay attention.
T Striker Om> It fits on your back, it's great for a snack, it's LOG LOG LOG.
T protodude_> You probably have Private RPs with her, too.
T Striker Om> ...Why he can't be on the phone in front of the computer is beyond me.
T protodude_> Time for me to go, now.
T       T.J.> I'm a guy, I can't multitask

T protodude_> BGUWHZ?
        T.J.> He's got two minutes before he's toast
T protodude_> Yeah, TJ
T protodude_> Blame it on having Brain Damage.
  Blade_Serp> No no no. I'm gonna play this one out fair.
T       T.J.> Actually, it's provne that women are indeed better at multitasking than men
  Blade_Serp> I refuse to win because his parents yelled at him or something.
T protodude_> Really?
        T.J.> No, that;s the rules
        T.J.> More or less
T       T.J.> Yeah
  Blade_Serp> F the rules.
T       T.J.> Guys are better at more focused things, like reading maps
T protodude_> How comes I can watch TV, Play Computer, Listen to Music, and talk on the phone at the same time?
  Next elimination match is starting. Type ?go baseelim to play
        T.J.> The rules F you
T Striker Om> I dunno...I'm pretty good at multitasking
T protodude_> Same here
T Striker Om> I think that's just a personal problem, man.
T       T.J.> So you think, but the women are better
T Striker Om> It doesn't matter who's better at it.
T NessTheHer> I can sometimes do two things at once
  This just in.. BEbobobeepboop bee boop bee boop boop ?go racebase -LMAO <ER>
  Next elimination match is starting. Type ?go elim to play
  Blade_Serp> >.>
T Striker Om> Just because women can do it better doesn't mean men can't do it at all. :P
  Blade_Serp> <.<
T       T.J.> I can watch over the chat room and talk on the phone at the same time, but I can't have two conversations at once
T protodude_> Wait
T Striker Om> ...then, theoretically, you could also be talking to your girlfriend now.
T protodude_> How are you having 2 Competitions?
T protodude_> Conversations, even.
T       T.J.> I'm just talking to you guys right now
T Striker Om> You can be watching, and intervene when you need to.
T       T.J.> She's looking around onlien for stuff
T NessTheHer> Man, I can talk to like . . . 18 people at once on AIM
        T.J.> I'll give him another minute
T Striker Om> Aha, he pinged out.
T       T.J.> Technically my multitasking problem is that I have to keep switching between a window and a full screen window
T Striker Om> Oh. I run Continuum in a window.
T Striker Om> yea!
