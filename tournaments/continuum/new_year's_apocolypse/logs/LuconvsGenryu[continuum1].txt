T        Striker Omega> Lucon is retaining a seven--wait eight win lead.
T          NessTheHero> Proto is half assing this only because he probably thinks Lucon sucks
T          NessTheHero> Which is the opposite, because Lucon actually plays
T             UrutoraD> Or, he really does suck
              Madarrow> The score is Lucon:21   Proto:15
T          NessTheHero> One minute?
T             UrutoraD> Hm
              Madarrow> 1 minute remaining
T        Striker Omega> I would wager that since Lucon seems to play more, it is simply a case of skill.
                 Lucon> 15... seconds... remayning
T             UrutoraD> I wonder how I will fare agaisnt Blade
