C 1:T.J.> #bngwars
        T.J.> Okay, coombatants ready?
        T.J.> That usually elicits a yes or no response
   Fusion_AX> Roger.
T protoman_1> Mr TJ, it looks like we're in for another (a)Rousing matchup between Fusion and Ness!
  NessTheHer> ya
        T.J.> Okay then
        T.J.> MATCH BEGIN!
T       T.J.> Time start
T Striker Om> start'd
T protoman_1> So, Mr. TJ. What are your thoughts on this matchup?
T       T.J.> Let them know at 10, 5, and 1. I'll give th scores
T       T.J.> Well Mr. Man, I'm not sure
T       T.J.> Fusion is one of the best Lancasters the squad has ever seen
T       T.J.> But Ness has been known to deliver a mean bitch slap
T protoman_1> Though, you forget, Ness is one of the best at Firing people.
T protoman_1> Although not in a ship!
T       T.J.> Oh, burn Mr. Man, burn
T Striker Om> And Ness is good at killing you when he reads the log!
T protoman_1> Indeed he is, Mr. Omega!
T       T.J.> Quite right Mr. Omega
T       T.J.> So, do we have any bets today?
T protoman_1> I bet my Bacon Factory that Fusion wins.
T Des Gardiu> I say Ness wins
T protoman_1> 3 misses at point blank from Fusion!
T       T.J.> Okay, who fired first there?
T protoman_1> That's 1 Double Kill, folks!
T       T.J.> Was it Ness or Fusion?
T protoman_1> It doesn't matter, TJ.  Double kills don't count.
        T.J.> Just a reminded, no spawn killing. 3-4 seconds after spawning
T       T.J.> It does matter, if Fusion attempted to Spawn Kill, he's roast
T protoman_1> Ah, Spawn kill, I didn't notice that, Mr. TJ!
T protoman_1> Good eye!
T       T.J.> Fusion is making good use of the Lancaster's normal shot mode
T       T.J.> This is what you should have done Striker >>
T protoman_1> Allow me to mention, that Fusion has the advantage in Energy Saving.
T protoman_1> Think of it like this...
T Des Gardiu> g This is sorta what I did with GB
T Striker Om> Yes, considering I was at a long distance the whole match.
T protoman_1> Ness is running a SUV.
T protoman_1> And Fusion is running a Hybrid.
T       T.J.> Ooh, good shot Ness
T Des Gardiu> I waited until the opponent was weak, then picked him off with multiple weak shots
T protoman_1> Indeed it was, Mr. TJ.
T       T.J.> Don't forget the time. Just a reminder
T Striker Om> I'm totally taking screenshots too
T protoman_1> Totally, indeed, Mr. Omega.
T       T.J.> Was it just me, or was that less than three seconds?
  Striker Om> Five minutes elapsed
T Des Gardiu> g We still got 10 minutes or so
T protoman_1> Remember, TJ. There was one Double kill
        T.J.> SCORE: Fusion - 9  Ness - 6
T protoman_1> 5 for Ness.
T Des Gardiu> And i'm used to the fact that you need a G in Dofus to talk to squad people
T protoman_1> Well, NOW 6.
T       T.J.> It matters not. If they kill each other, both of their scores go up
T protoman_1> Yes, but you gave Ness one more point
T protoman_1> Out of boundaries!
T       T.J.> He's back in
T       T.J.> I got it covered Mr. Man, don't worry
T protoman_1> Indeed he is.
T protoman_1> Indeed you do.
        T.J.> Remember to stay in bounds
T Des Gardiu> Yeah, i'm gonna lose the farm for betting on Ness. :/
T protoman_1> Indeed is copyrighted by Baconman Inc.
T Striker Om> The hell it is.
T       T.J.> Good shot Ness
T protoman_1> Indeed you're wrong, Striker.
T protoman_1> Mr. Omega, sorry for that outburst.
T       T.J.> Ness would be best off trying to snipe Fusion
T protoman_1> I do not know what came over me.
T       T.J.> Close range combat will get him killed
T       T.J.> then again
T protoman_1> Or sneaking up on him like Solid Snake in a Box!
T       T.J.> Good shot Ness
T protoman_1> I'd like to remind our viewers, that this match is brought to you by the Refreshing Taste of UltraD!
T protoman_1> Now in UltraBerry Flavor!
T       T.J.> Matrix shot!
T       T.J.> Nesseo and Agent Fusion both miss each other
T protoman_1> It's time to D-D-D-D-D-D-Double kill!
T       T.J.> So much double killing

  Next elimination match is starting. Type ?go baseelim to play
T protoman_1> Double kill, again!
T protoman_1> This reminds me of Gardius' and GB's fight!
T protoman_1> Except the person I want to win IS winning!
T Des Gardiu> Fusion's only winning because he's using the strategy I did
T Des Gardiu> Which is he's waiting until Ness fires, then shoots him when he's weak
T protoman_1> Ludicrous Kill!
T protoman_1> That's how the Lancaster works, Mr. Gardius!
T       T.J.> Ness has to make better use of his speed
T Des Gardiu> It's also how spiders work
T       T.J.> Good shot Ness!
T protoman_1> Mr. Gardius, I have a Question for you.
T protoman_1> Why the Des?
T Des Gardiu> No clue
T protoman_1> Are you like a Des Kangaroo?
T Des Gardiu> I think it's German for 'the' or something
T       T.J.> Striker? Time?
T protoman_1> Striker, Time?
T protoman_1> ...XD
T Des Gardiu> Stop! Striker time!
  Striker Om> About 9 minutes left.
T protoman_1> 9 minutes?
T protoman_1> WTF mate?
  Striker Om> Er
T Des Gardiu> Nine? Lies! 4. Maybe 3
  Striker Om> Four
        T.J.> SCORE: Fusion - 25  Ness - 18
T Striker Om> Misread it.
T protoman_1> Or 2, or 1, or BLAST OFF
T Des Gardiu> you fail. :P
T       T.J.> Indeed
T Striker Om> Hey, at least I realized it as soon as I said it
T protoman_1> Indeed he does, Mr. Gardius.  Or, rather, phail
T Des Gardiu> But is it a phail pail?
T protoman_1> Double kill, again
T protoman_1> This IS the Match between Gardius and GB.
T Striker Om> It's stfu and focus on the match :P
T protoman_1> Is this a Rerun?
T Des Gardiu> It's the same thing, except we were both in spiders
T protoman_1> At the end.
T Des Gardiu> Or rather, It was later
T       T.J.> I swear, for my matches, I'm going to get one kill in, then just run like hell
T Striker Om> Does someone have a good batch updater?
T Des Gardiu> Pansy
T protoman_1> Pansy ho.
T protoman_1> Or rather.
T Striker Om> or something that will convert a bunch of files at the same time?
T protoman_1> Mrs. Pansy Ho
T       T.J.> Don't forget the one minute mark Striker
T Striker Om> I won't
T protoman_1> I believe this is one of the ONLY matches where Neither competetor has switched ships!
T Des Gardiu> One minute left right now I think
T       T.J.> Ooh, bitch slapped from behind an asteroid
T Striker Om> Not quite
T Des Gardiu> About
  Striker Om> One minute left
T Des Gardiu> Hey, this match might end just as my Katamari Damacy song is ending! :D
T protoman_1> I say Double Kills should count.  It raises both scores, anyways.
T       T.J.> Eh, kinda pointless to give them their scores at one minute
T protoman_1> I don't think Ness can come back from this.
T       T.J.> *beats Genryu with a Katamary*
T protoman_1> He's down 10.
T       T.J.> *Katamari
T Striker Om> Looks familiar ._.
  Striker Om> TIME
T protoman_1> FUSION JUST MIGHT FO ALL THE WAAAY!
T Des Gardiu> And I lose the farm. Go me
        T.J.> MATCH OVER
T protoman_1> All your Farm are belong to me.
T Des Gardiu> What you say?
        T.J.> FINAL SCORE: Fusion - 38  Ness - 28
        T.J.> Fusion_AX is the winner!
T protoman_1> Your are on your way to Homogenization.
T protoman_1> Make your milk.
   Fusion_AX> o/~ Everybody dance around the world! o/~
T protoman_1> Ha ha ha.
T Des Gardiu> Ew
  Time to have your dreams become true! Basing in a thin base you can fit in! ?go thinbase -Melo
        T.J.> A very good job by both combatants!
T protoman_1> ...Thin Base?
  protoman_1> WTF, Thin Base?
   Fusion_AX> Good match, Ness.
  NessTheHer> same
        T.J.> Viewers are free to make comments
T Des Gardiu> I'm gonna go check it out. I'm bored
  protoman_1> I have one thing to say before Genryu signs off
  protoman_1> I am the Baconman, bring all the pork I can,
  protoman_1> to all the little kids down the row!
  protoman_1> Clogging their arteries, with all the MSG's,
  protoman_1> Then they'll all die at the age of eight!
C 1:Des Gardius> Well, ti's thin all right
        T.J.> Or if there are none, I shall close the log
