<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<dl>
	<dt>Q: Why did you make this squad?</dt>
	<dd>A: Back during the summer of 2003, many people in the BnG community thought the community was lacking fellowship, and ultimately "dying." NessTheHero found Continuum at Starman.net, through a tournament they were holding, and decided it would be fun to get some BnGers involved.</dd>
	<dt>Q: Who founded the squad?</dt>
	<dd>A: Officially, it was protoman_116, but only because he was the only one who knew how to make a squad. NessTheHero brought us all to the game, so you could say he founded it also. The leadership was eventually passed to GB330033, who leads it now.</dd>
	<dt>Q: What does BnG stand for?</dt>
	<dd>A: BnG is the official acronym of the sprite comic, Bob and George. You can find it at www.bobandgeorge.com</dd>
	<dt>Q: Is it BnG Squad, or Squad BnG?</dt>
	<dd>A: Well, depends on who you ask. We don't mind either, but we usually call ourselves Squad BnG, just sounds better.</dd>
	<dt>Q: Can I join the squad?</dt>
	<dd>A: Submit your application through the link on the left menu. It will be processed, and you may or may not be accepted.</dd>
	<dt>Q: Can I join your tournaments?</dt>
	<dd>A: If you're in the squad, yes. Otherwise, no. The system isn't designed to handle outsiders.</dd>
	<dt>Q: What games do you play?</dt>
	<dd>A: Currently, we play Continuum, TetriNET, Planetia, Starcraft, Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, GunZ, DnD, Gunbound, Halo, and more. Note: We don't play all of these on a regular basis, but most of us have them.</dd>
	<dt>Q: Who are your members?</dt>
	<dd>A: Check the Members page, accessible by the menu on the left.</dd>
	<dt>Q: Who are the people in power?</dt>
	<dd>A: GB330033 and NessTheHero are currently the people in charge of all aspects of the squad. TJ and Striker assist as Chatroom Operators. GB and Ness's email address are located at the bottom of the page. Striker and TJ can be reached through the chatroom.</dd>
	<dt>Q: How can I get in touch with the Squad?</dt>
	<dd>A: We've got our forums, to start. Second, we're on IRC, at irc.darkmyst.org, #squadbng. We've got several people in there at all times. There's also AIM, and other IM programs, including XFire, which is nifty. We also, from time to time, use voice chat programs. Check the IRC channel for that information.</dd>
	<dt>Q: What do you do besides play games?</dt>
	<dd>A: We're not just a bunch of gaming geeks. We also talk about life, current events, all the stuff a community does. We've got our own radio service, based in our IRC channel, where you can listen to music.</dd>
	<dt>Q: What is this comic business?</dt>
	<dd>A: Check with Jhang about that. We once decided to do a comic, but it died out. Jhang thought it was a good idea, and took it upon himself to continue the "comic business".</dd>
	<dt>Q: Can I join your forums?</dt>
	<dd>A: Yes. Anyone may join our forums.</dd>
	<dt>Q: What is a "raid" all about?</dt>
	<dd>A: Well, "raid" is a Continuum term we use to refer to when our squad goes out and private-freqs in a public arena. This is one of our favorite things to do, as it spices up our time on the game, and pub life. We try to not outnumber a pub, so if one empties after we've been raiding a while, we'll either change arenas, or stop raiding.</dd>
