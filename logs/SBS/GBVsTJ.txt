T  ProdemBot> comon gb hit HIM
T Hylianbunn> Sort of.
T      Lucon> Jacen, GB's not gonna win.
T NessTheHer> I've gotten a bit better in Spid vs Spid
T  ProdemBot> yea he wil
T      Lucon> If he uses the spider strategy, anyway.
T  ProdemBot> will*
T  ProdemBot> i won w/ spider
T      Lucon> That's because you weren't facing anyone good.
T NessTheHer> You have to ration shots and weaken them
T NessTheHer> Or wait until they fire and shoot
T      Lucon> As much as it pains me to say it, Sei isn't too good at this game.
T   OmniPaul> Terrier is totally the best ship
       Elios> That looks wrong...
T  ProdemBot> hmmm
T NessTheHer> Did we enforce the 2 ship changes? I mean, did we agree on them?
T      Lucon> No.
T  rusty69xy> nope
T NessTheHer> Okay
T Hylianbunn> Oh, while everyone's here...
T  ProdemBot> oh my....gb's gonna be out after this match...

    GB330033> Aw screw it
T Hylianbunn> Like backgrounds and places.
T      Lucon> Bunny, I needed to ask you something.
T Hylianbunn> Yes?
T      Lucon> Would a sorcerer/shadow dancer be less effective without clothes?
T Hylianbunn> ...
   ProdemBot> GB, plz state that you are going to change ships next time
T Hylianbunn> O_O
  NessTheHer> 10:00
    GB330033> Ah, my bad

   ProdemBot> GB - 4
T Hylianbunn> Let me check my...um...DM's guide...yes...O-o;;
   ProdemBot> TJ - 2
T      Lucon> Because I really don't want to go to all the trouble to get enough gold to buy new ones.

T      Lucon> Since I have 0 gold right now.
    GB330033> Toasty!
T  rusty69xy> GBs on fire
T  ProdemBot> yep
T NessTheHer> GB is doing much better in WB
T  rusty69xy> he will win
T      Lucon> Well, I'm surprised he's this good.
T   OmniPaul> Well, at least you wouldn't get a armor penalty on hide checks
T      Lucon> He hardly ever plays.
T  ProdemBot> yea

T Hylianbunn> There is no reason that a sorc/shadow dancer is less effective with clothes...except for your sanity and decency.
T Hylianbunn> That too.
       Elios> .....
T  ProdemBot> lol
    GB330033> Toasty!
T      Lucon> Well, she's chaotic neutral.
T  rusty69xy> OOOOO
       Elios> I seriously dislike you
T      Lucon> She's already insane.
T      Lucon> Because of the alignment change I mentioned earlier.
       Elios> Ship change
       Elios> 1
    GB330033> ^_^
   ProdemBot> k
       Elios> Why couldn;t you stay spider?
T  ProdemBot> this is bad
T   OmniPaul> I made a sorceror, so if we ever stop off at a forest or anything, that would be ideal for a character swap
T NessTheHer> Yay Geebs!
   rusty69xy> GB you must have 3rd degree burns
T NessTheHer> Team chat
   ProdemBot> Rusty plz stick to team chat
