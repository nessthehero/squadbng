T             UrutoraD> Do I say the Go or does Ness do that?

T             GB330033> Dude...Xero is gonna pwn
              UrutoraD> Yes
T                Elios> I hope so
           NessTheHero> Alright
T         Magnus_Rage0> Proto is disqualified for inco-operation.
T             GB330033> If he spiders like he did earlier
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD
T                Elios> I'm now betting Proto on Xero
           NessTheHero> BEGIN!!!!
          protoman_116> Damn butterflies
T         Magnus_Rage0> Xero will win.
T             GB330033> I bet a dalmation on Xero
T         Magnus_Rage0> He has to.
T                Elios> If so, then he owns Proto
T         Magnus_Rage0> I bet my boat on him
T                Elios> Ow...
T             UrutoraD> I'm gonna go for proto
T         Magnus_Rage0> Ah shoot
T             GB330033> Hmmm...
T             GB330033> Proto is smart
T                Elios> Duh
T             UrutoraD> But hopefully he loses :P
T             GB330033> Sticking to the bar
T          NessTheHero> No, proto is a general idiot
T                Elios> He's not ENTIRELY stupid
T                Lucon> He's a coward is what he is.
T         Magnus_Rage0> Well said Ness
          protoman_116> Why did I say Butterflies?
          protoman_116> owie
T         Magnus_Rage0> YEAH!
T             GB330033> Lucon...
T                Lucon> Although that's a good strategy against spiders, I guess.
T                Elios> Huzzah for Xero!
T             UrutoraD> No!
T             GB330033> You fly an X...I wouldnt call anyone cowardly
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD
T             GB330033> =P
T         Magnus_Rage0> Very nice.
T          NessTheHero> Xs can be used strategically
T             GB330033> I know
T          NessTheHero> Mr. X-hater
T         Magnus_Rage0> But they're still cowardly
T                Elios> >.<
T             GB330033> I'm just messing with Lucon
T         Magnus_Rage0> :P
T                Elios> You are?
T         Magnus_Rage0> Really?
T         Magnus_Rage0> I'm not.
T         Magnus_Rage0> ^^
T                Elios> Double KEEEEL
          protoman_116> NC? or what?
T          NessTheHero> Then shut up, sucka
T         Magnus_Rage0> Geez.
                 Elios> NC is not in effect
          protoman_116> Goodie
T         Magnus_Rage0> It's gonna be a close match
T             UrutoraD> The best strategy to escape a Spider is to freaking Shake it lika a Polaroid picture!
C 1:UrutoraD> Nothing more, nothing less
T                Elios> I do just that
C 1:protoman_116> o.O
T             GB330033> Or, stay up close
T             UrutoraD> Grah
T          NessTheHero> I like digital cameras
T         Magnus_Rage0> Yeah.
T             GB330033> XD
T         Magnus_Rage0> That's what I did GB.
T                Elios> I twist and turn like nobodies bussiness
T                Elios> D'oh
T         Magnus_Rage0> He'd volley a bunch of long range shots at me, then I'd go in close
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD
          protoman_116> bar is MY domain
T             GB330033> Proto jas this down
             XeroLogik> ...
T         Magnus_Rage0> Crap it
T                Elios> Eep...

          protoman_116> X-tra Large?
T         Magnus_Rage0> Okay...
T             GB330033> If Xero could get up on him...he could just run
T          NessTheHero> Excellent strategy
T                Elios> If Blade hdes behind the circle during my match, can we disqualify him?
T          NessTheHero> Xero retreats to draw him out
T             GB330033> No
T                Elios> It;s so laaame
T         Magnus_Rage0> Now I put the Black Pearl on Proto
T         Magnus_Rage0> >.>
T         Magnus_Rage0> <.<
T             UrutoraD> <>< ><> swim fishies swim
T             GB330033> Proto doesnt have to go after Xero at all
             XeroLogik> ... ><
T                Elios> It's practically a failproof cowardice thingy
T             GB330033> TJ, not if you work it right
T         Magnus_Rage0> Good move.
T          NessTheHero> Proto is such a wuss
          protoman_116> eeep
T             GB330033> Hmmm...
T          NessTheHero> For the log . . .
T             UrutoraD> Hm...
T             UrutoraD> If proto wins

T         Magnus_Rage0> He's refusing to leave that bar
          protoman_116> damnit
T             UrutoraD> Who do you think will win in the Me vs Proto match?
          protoman_116> shoulda changed my res
T                Lucon> I can't figure out how to make the jav shoot backwards.
T         Magnus_Rage0> Bwuh?
T                Lucon> Unless I gave it a negative speed...
T             GB330033> Lucon, set the bullet speed to negative
              UrutoraD> 10 minutes left
T                Elios> Ten minutes left
T         Magnus_Rage0> He jsut totally disbands his strategy?
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD
T             GB330033> XD
T             GB330033> Now...Xero needs to get into spider
T             GB330033> And fast
          protoman_116> Ness?
T         Magnus_Rage0> Yep.

T         Magnus_Rage0> Interesting choice
T             UrutoraD> He went poopie
T          NessTheHero> He died
          protoman_116> This is more Hide and Seek then duel
          protoman_116> XD
T         Magnus_Rage0> Here we go
T         Magnus_Rage0> This is how it's done
T         Magnus_Rage0> ^^
             XeroLogik> ><
T             GB330033> Xero isnt as good as proto in WB
             XeroLogik> Yea... any money on me?
T         Magnus_Rage0> I know.
T             GB330033> Spider is his best bet
          protoman_116> prolly
T             UrutoraD> Grah
T         Magnus_Rage0> But now Proto's not hiding at that bar
T          NessTheHero> Maybe because he hasn't played in a millenia
          protoman_116> everyone hates me XD
T         Magnus_Rage0> Well, he wasn't
T             UrutoraD> I'm nervous on who is going to win
T          NessTheHero> YES! I HATE YOU PROTO!
T             GB330033> Ness, he's actually played a bunch lately

T             UrutoraD> Sigh
T             GB330033> And Proto is back to the bar
T             GB330033> Heh, Xero should mine the bar
T         Magnus_Rage0> But if he doesn't find a way to beat Proto's bar strat, he's a goner
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD
          protoman_116> Hmmm...
T             GB330033> Then try to duel in Shark
T             UrutoraD> It's boring when the whole match is being on a bar
T         Magnus_Rage0> I don't think 4 minse will be enough, GB
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD
T         Magnus_Rage0> ^mines
T          NessTheHero> Shut it, Maguns
T             GB330033> Proto, be sure to reead this part...

T             GB330033> But by strategy
T         Magnus_Rage0> He's in a Terr
T             GB330033> XD
T          NessTheHero> Proto needs to quit making remarks during a match. It makes him look cocky
T         Magnus_Rage0> He's in a freaking Terr
T          NessTheHero> Of which he already is
T         Magnus_Rage0> And he KILLED HIM!

           NessTheHero> Xero wins
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD
T             UrutoraD> Worst way to lose....EVAH!
             XeroLogik> It don't feel right.
T         Magnus_Rage0> Well...
T         Magnus_Rage0> That was interesting.
                 Lucon> Whoa
T                Elios> Very
                 Lucon> Hey, why did proto leave?
                 Lucon> Oh, it's over.
           NessTheHero> Final Score: 16 - 3
T             UrutoraD> He got pissed?
                 Elios> Any last comments?
T         Magnus_Rage0> XD

             XeroLogik> Just don't feel right.
          Magnus_Rage0> That was entertaining
                 Lucon> What the hell?
           NessTheHero> Proto got score, but Xero wins by disqualification
                 Lucon> Shouldn't you give him another chance?
           NessTheHero> -- End Log --

-- Due to varied arguements and the pissy squad members who drove me nuts, Xero 
forfeited his match and Proto advanced, even though he actually did break the rules. --
