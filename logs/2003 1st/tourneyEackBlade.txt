    GB330033> Its odd the way these things work...
    UrutoraD> what
    GB330033> Eack had an amazing lead
  Blade_Serp> I was warming up.
    Spearman> Maybe he just got overconfident
    GB330033> Then lost it, just like in the Shard-Balikka match
        Eack> Then Spearman turned on the lights
    GB330033> Cept Shard couldnt quite catch up
    Spearman> You asked me to turn on the lights
    Spearman> It's your own fault
    GB330033> Well, time to end the log
        Eack> I still blame you
