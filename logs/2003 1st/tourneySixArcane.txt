T   UrutoraD> yeah
T Shard Ange> Arcane isn't hiding.
  Dark_Palad> where the hell are you...?
   Arcane655> If anyone's watching me, I'm doing a lot, eh?
T Shard Ange> Six is just being a tard and not figuring out that he's in base.
T protoman_1> Arcane IS hiding... he's probably waiting until time starts to run out, then kill six once, and hide again...
T Shard Ange> It's not hiding.
  Dark_Palad> .......
T Shard Ange> In that tunnel, he can burst.
   Arcane655> CASTLE HALLWAY.
T protoman_1> Ah... that's right.
T   Spearman> At the rate this is going, we're gonna go into overtime from nobody killing anyone =/
  protoman_1> Chh-chh-chh-haa-haa-haa...
  protoman_1> Ah ah ah! not aloud to go any further than the red gate.
   Arcane655> We aren't?
  Dark_Palad> screw that
   Arcane655> Ya should've TOLD me.
  Dark_Palad> get the hell out here. =P
T   UrutoraD> wait, aren't you not able to be in base?
   Arcane655> I already used all my items. >_<
T protoman_1> I didn't make the rules... I just follow them.
T   GB330033> No base
T   GB330033> Cept the hallway
T   GB330033> The first level is it

  Dark_Palad> ........
T protoman_1> Control.
   Arcane655> >_<>_<>_<>_<
  Dark_Palad> this is going to be a long match...
T   GB330033> Was that another double kill?
   Arcane655> Possibly.
   Arcane655> >_> <_<
    UrutoraD> 10 mins left
    GB330033> 2-2
  Shard Ange> No, it's going to take the same amount of time it always does.
    GB330033> Heh
  Shard Ange> I have an idea for sudden death! :o
T   Spearman> The Fire button. The one that sets your computer on fire =P
    GB330033> I was about to say that
T   GB330033> What is it Shard?
T   UrutoraD> isnt it tab?
  Shard Ange> They go terr, I go warbird, and we see who can stay alive! :P
   Arcane655> Oof, nice.
  protoman_1> hehehe...
  protoman_1> I like that idea...
T   GB330033> Shard, team chat please...
T   GB330033> Everyone team chat please
  Dark_Palad> ha ha!
   Arcane655> OOouch.
  protoman_1> 3-2
T Shard Ange> Umm, the log's there to entertain, ain't it? :P
T   GB330033> Proto, scores only at 10, 5 and 1 minute
T   GB330033> Yeah
   Arcane655> Ouuuuuch.

T   GB330033> 4-2
T   UrutoraD> go yaffa
T protoman_1> Damnit, quit talking about Yaffa!
   Arcane655> I'm not THAT cheap.
T Striker_Om> I still wonder how much of Redeal and Uru's fight you guys will actually be able to use?
T Shard Ange> Six ain't HALF as good as he thinks he is... but using a terr against him is bloody stupid.
  Next elimination match is starting. Type ?go elim to play
T   GB330033> I know
T   GB330033> Arcane likes Terrs though.
   Arcane655> >_<
T   GB330033> Mostly cause theyre underpowered
T protoman_1> The good thing about Terrs are they are fast... the bad thing is it's suicide to go up to a Lanc in them...
T Striker_Om> If nothing, he needs to wait until Six shoots.
T   GB330033> Yeah
  Dark_Palad> score?
T   UrutoraD> it makes me laugh
   Arcane655> 2-358341591.
T protoman_1> UNLESS he can get him into a small space...
    GB330033> Not till 5 minutes
  Shard Ange> NO SCORE FOR YOU
  Next elimination match is starting. Type ?go baseelim to play
T   GB330033> Tis 6-2 right?

T protoman_1> to long a reload time...
   Arcane655> Agh, I'm doing TERRIBLE.
T   GB330033> I dont know, if he could get close...
T Striker_Om> How so? It's not that bad.
T   GB330033> NOW THATS A BAD IDEA...
T   Spearman> Well, at least he's not using a Levi =P
T protoman_1> A LEVI?!
T   GB330033> Yeah
T   GB330033> Speak of the devil Spearman
T Striker_Om> That's it. He's gone nucking futs.
T   Spearman> XD He's joking, right?
T   UrutoraD> Arcane=(o-_-)p
T protoman_1> ... oh my god... isn't that the first time in the tourny that someone has used a Levi?
   Arcane655> I'm bad at timing repels, too.
  Dark_Palad> eeeeee if you hit that yellow bar...
T   GB330033> I think its hopeless now, and Arcane knows it
T Striker_Om> Uh....
T protoman_1> Yeah, he's just having fun with is now.
T Striker_Om> okay......
T   Spearman> Was that all his repels?
T   GB330033> Yeah
T   Spearman> XP
   Arcane655> I was THIIIIS CLOOOSE to teleport.
T   GB330033> Time Uru?
   Arcane655> Eww, I hate myself for doing this.
    GB330033> Heh
T   Spearman> Score?
T   GB330033> Arcane despises Warbirds
   Arcane655> Agh
    UrutoraD> 4 mins left
T   GB330033> Its like 8-2 or somthing right?
T Shard Ange> How ingeniously self-destroying.
T   GB330033> I lost track
   Arcane655> AGH.
   Arcane655> I think I lost badly.
    GB330033> 9-2
   Arcane655> Yeaaah.
  Dark_Palad> who's winning?
  Dark_Palad> <_<
   Arcane655> You are.
T   Spearman> I think he's used all the ships except for spider and shark
T   GB330033> No, he was shark for a second
T   UrutoraD> did you lose track with Redeal?
   Arcane655> SWEEEEEET!
T Striker_Om> Yes, Arcane is dropping his inhibitions.
T   GB330033> Yes Uru, I did
   Arcane655> Stupid asteroid.
T Striker_Om> Too little, too late.
T   GB330033> 10-3
   Arcane655> You're SUPPOSED TO BLOCK THE FRICKING SHOT.
   Arcane655> Not block all but what kills me.
T   Spearman> Kinda one sided, isn't it? =P
T   GB330033> Yeah
T   GB330033> Arcane just isnt a dueler
T   GB330033> Better than Redeal though...
   Arcane655> >_<>_<>_<
  Dark_Palad> ....wow.
   Arcane655> Wow.
T Shard Ange> Six's use of momentum - or lack thereof - is making me wince.
T   GB330033> 11-5
T   GB330033> Heh
   Arcane655> BACK TO MY ROOTS.
T   Spearman> Drifting off topic, has anyone seen Vidgamer lately?
T Striker_Om> It's sad. Neither of the fight's I've seen have been very interesting....
T protoman_1> no... not really...
T   GB330033> I'll get in touch with him tonight
T   Spearman> I have a tourney match with him, and I wanna get it done
T Striker_Om> Both were horridly one-sided
T   Spearman> Hold on a sec
T Shard Ange> BLARGGGGHHH
T protoman_1> Did you see mine? :/
T   Spearman> He hasn't played the game in 6 days
T Shard Ange> I wish I hadn't abruptly started sucking against Balikka.
T Shard Ange> At least I evened it up.
    UrutoraD> 1 min left
T   GB330033> Yeah
T Striker_Om> Fraid not, Proto.
   Arcane655> STUPID.
   Arcane655> I think I'm dead.
    GB330033> I think its like 15-6
   Arcane655> Yep.
T protoman_1> Yeah, you would've hated it, it was kinda one sided.
   Arcane655> Bai, my chances.
    GB330033> I lost track ^_^
   Arcane655> AGHH!@H$I!@$!@$!@$!@$@!$!#@*)%&!@#)*%!&@*)%!@#&*)%@#!%&)!!
   Arcane655> I hit ROCKET!
    UrutoraD> time

    GB330033> Game over
    GB330033> 16-6 I think...
T   UrutoraD> yeah
    GB330033> Six wins!

   Arcane655> Yay!
    GB330033> Heh, odd...
    GB330033> 16-6
   Arcane655> Whooo!
T   UrutoraD> 23-6 right?
  Dark_Palad> you weren't too bad, man
   Arcane655> Actually, I was.
T Striker_Om> Everytime Uru scored a hit, Redeal started cursing.
    GB330033> Six did somthing to this match...
  Dark_Palad> so, how'd I do, you'd say?
  Dark_Palad> got any better?
   Arcane655> Er....
   Arcane655> IT WAS 16 to BLOODY 6.
   Arcane655> I don't think I need to say anything.
    GB330033> Yeah, I havent edited the log yet
    GB330033> I was trying to point out the 6's
